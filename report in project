Introduction:
This project is all about Chocopy language compiler. In this project I have used ChocoPy language. ChocoPy is a programming language designed for classroom use in undergraduate compilers courses. ChocoPy is a restricted subset of Python 3, which can easily be compiled to a target. The language is fully specified using formal grammar, typing rules, and operational semantics. I have built this project using LEX (lexical analyzer generator) and YACC (yet another compiler compiler). Lex and yacc are tools used to generate lexical analyzers and parsers.
